          <p class="description">Electricity has, for a long time, perplexed us humans. It is an intriguing aspect of this natural world. In essence, electriciy is a form of energy, same as mechanical energy and potential energy, but in another form. Electricity is the free movement of electrons in a path called an electric current. Using this electric current, we have developed uses such as lighting, charging batteries, spinning of devices, etc.

          <div class="first-equations">
            <div><code class="equation"> P = V X I </code></div>
            <div><code class="equation"> P = E / T </code></div>
          </div>
          <p class="description">The essence of electricity comes from the equations above. Power (Watts) is equal to the product of the Voltage (Volts) and Current (Ampere). Power is the amount of energy being supplied in a given time. The higher the Current or Voltage, the higher the power output.

          <h2 class="subtitle">What is the difference?</h2>
          <p class="description">Current is the rate at which electric charge is moving past a certain point in a given amount of time. Voltage is the "strength" of each electric charge moving past a certain point. Think of a river, the current is the rate of how much water moves past the beach you are on, the voltage is the strength of the water pushing on your leg when you go stand in the river.

          <h2 class="subtitle">How do we produce electricity?</h2>
          <p>When magnetism was discovered as directly related to electricity, Michael Faraday began working on generating an electric current by rotating a copper disc between the poles of a horshoe magnet. The next development was using a magnet rising and falling inside of a copper wire tube, the electric current generated was then "scraped" off by a strong conductor. Steam generators use steam to turn a wheel which as it rotates a copper ring around a magnet, generates electricity.</p>

            <li class="dude">
              <h4 class="name">Michael Faraday</h4>
              <p class="describe">Living from 1791 to 1867 in the U.K. Michael Farady discovered how to generate an electric current using his "Faraday Disc" generator. Without the knowledge of an electron or how electricity was transfered, Faraday revolutionized how electric current could be created.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="dude">
              <h4 class="name">Allesandro Volta</h4>
              <p class="describe">With electricity on the verge of making it useful, Volta discovered the law of capacitance, stating that in a given object, Electric Potential and Charge are proportional. Using his discovery of the Voltaic Pile, he was able to capture a charge. </p>
            </li>
            <li class="dude">
              <h4 class="name">Georg Ohm</h4>
              <p class="describe">This German physicist started as a school teacher and used his equipment to test the Voltaic Pile. He eventually discovered Ohm's Law stated here:</p>
              <code class="equation"> V = I X R </code>
              <p class="describe">The equation above states that voltage has a direct proportion to the product of Current and Resistance in a circuit.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="dude">
              <h4 class="name">Nikola Tesla</h4>
              <p class="describe">Exploring deep into electricity and the true magnitude of what it could accomplish, Nikola Tesla discovered many incredible uses, the most notable being the Tesla Coil. He also discovered wireless electrical power, and Alternating Current.</p>
            </li>
            <li class="dude">
              <h4 class="name">Thomas Edison</h4>
              <p class="describe">Most notable for his "invention" of the light bulb, Edison made incredible advances in electricity. Edison focused mainly on utilizing electricity to power different devicse, using Direct Current for most or all of his work.</p>
